# Questionnaire Flow

## Initial Questions (Phase 1)
1. **Annual Salary** - User's current annual income
2. **Age** - User's current age
3. **Target Retirement Age** - When they plan to retire

## Calculations from Initial Questions
- **Working Years** = Target Retirement Age - Age
- This determines the number of periods (years) in the model
- Initial table will show Year 1 through Year N (where N = working years)

## Future Questions (To be implemented)
- Income growth rate
- Additional income sources
- Monthly expenses
- Debt information
- Investment plans

## Notes
- All time periods are relative (Month 1, Year 1, etc.)
- No absolute dates used
- Questionnaire NOT YET BUILT - waiting for user to proceed
